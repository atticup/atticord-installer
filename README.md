# atticord-installer
Just the installer exe for atticord + the source code + everything needed for it to work in one place

Some instructions

If you see a blue Windows warning saying the app is from an untrusted source, that's just because the .exe isn't digitally signed—signing often costs over $100 a year, so it’s not something i've done. If that screen makes you're that much of a pussy that you don't trust me, you’re totally welcome to compile the atticordupdater.go file yourself (have fun btw ```go mod tidy``` will help you especially if you've never used go before)

That's pretty much it you can follow the instructions inside the exe and it should work if it doesn't just dm me on discord (qwackpr).
