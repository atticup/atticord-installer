# atticord-installer
Just the installer exe for atticord + the source code + everything needed for it to work in one place

# Some instructions

If you see a blue Windows warning saying the app is from an untrusted source, that's just because the .exe isn't digitally signed—signing often costs over $100 a year, so it’s not something i've done. If that screen makes you're that much of a pussy that you don't trust me, you’re totally welcome to compile the atticordupdater.go file yourself (have fun btw ```go mod tidy``` will help you especially if you've never used go before)

That's pretty much it you can follow the instructions inside the exe and it should work if it doesn't just dm me on discord (qwackpr).

# (btw thanks alot for vencord for making this project possible with their amazing expandable structure if you can afford it definitely go support them https://github.com/sponsors/Vendicated in addition thanks for equicord for having an amazing plugin list and an updated dev build again if you can afford it feel free to support them here https://ko-fi.com/authenticators) supporting either vencord or equicord will give you custom badges using their badgeapi plugin which every vencord/equicord user can see (please notice that equicord badges only appear for users on equicord)
